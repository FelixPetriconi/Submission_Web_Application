Hi {},

You submitted the {} session proposal for ACCU 2018:

{}

We sent out an email just before the end of 2017 thanking you for making the
submission and stating that we would like to accept this session into the ACCU
2018 programme. We asked if the named presenter(s) are willing and able to put
the session on, and if you could get back to use quickly telling us if you were
either accepting or declining this acceptance offer. We have no record of
receiving an email back from you. We are not able to publish the conference
schedule till we have all the sessions acknowledged. We would appreciate it if
you can email us immediately.
