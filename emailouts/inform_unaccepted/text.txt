Thank you for submitting the {} proposal:

{}

to ACCU 2019.

The conference committee had a very difficult set of choices to make as we had
so many very good proposals we could not fit all of them into the
programme. We now have a complete schedule with all slots filled, there is no
room for any more unless someone drops out.

Sadly, at this time, we have not been able to fit this session proposal into
the schedule. If we do get drop outs (unlikely now, but historically it has
happened) we have a "reserve list" of people we will ask if they are willing
and able to step in. On the one hand I am hoping not to have to do this, but
if I do we can be confident that the reserve list are high quality proposals,
they just didn't make the initial cut.

Sorry we weren't able to fit this proposal into the schedule.
