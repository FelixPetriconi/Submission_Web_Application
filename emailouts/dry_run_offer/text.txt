Just to note that for people in locations where there is an ACCU local
group, there may be an opportunity to "dry run" your ACCU 2018
presentation. Most ACCU local branches reserve February and March meetings
for people to do ACCU conference related sessions so as to give conference
presenters a bit of practice of their material.

If you would like to take up the opportunity, please contact your local ACCU
branch organiser, or Nigel Lester <nigellester99@gmail.com> who is the ACCU
local groups liaison.
