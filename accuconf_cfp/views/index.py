This Web application is just for submitting proposals, the
<a href="https://conference.accu.org">main website</a>
 is where to go to get information about the conference. 
</p>
<p>
There are two blog posts that might be particularly interesting for submitters:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://conference.accu.org/posts/2017/201710150748_proposalsforaccu2018.html">Proposals for ACCU 2018</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://conference.accu.org/posts/2017/201710150836_whatsaccuabout.html">What's ACCU About</a> 
</li>
</ul>
</i>
<p>
Using the menu items on the left, you can register, if you are not already registered,
or login if you are already registered â€“ you have to have registered in order to login.
</p>
<p>
You will have to click one of them to do more than look at this screen. :-)
