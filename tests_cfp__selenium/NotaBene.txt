Usually in testing each test function is independent of all other tests. In this test suite,
this is not the case. The test server and test driver for this suite are module based.
This means that the tests in each module are coupled  because of the shared state of the
server database and the driver. This means that the sequence of tests in a module is
significant. Pytest by default executes tests in definition sequence and this is relied on
in these tests.

Some of the modules have a collection of independent tests, for example all the
"page accessibility" tests. However the other modules are definitely sequences of tests.
The tests rely on the build up of state in the database and possibly the driver. They are
scenarios being played out. If tests in a module are rearranged the tests will most
likely fail.

By making the module the unit of independent testing, the incremental tested build
up of state can be achieved. If there is an alternative way of achieving this that leads
to independent tests do send in an issue.
